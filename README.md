# Utilities for the second lab class in aisde
Basically utilities to plot time complexity of different sorting algorithms

Nine hours of life wasted, hope someone, someday will have easier life because of it

Usage:
Set desired parameters in `src/control*` files, then:
```bash
./lab.sh
```
and follow the instructions.

### Hint
Choose filename accordingly to the algorithm you want to test. Eg. `quick_lomuto` or `heap_leaf_root_exchange`.  
You can type it with underscores (`_`) or with spaces (` `), which will be automatically converted to underscores.

Usage of comparison of two or more algorithms is explained in lab.sh file.

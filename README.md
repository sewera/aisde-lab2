# Utilities for the second lab class in aisde
Basically utilities to plot time complexity of different sorting algorithms

Nine hours of life wasted, hope someone, someday will have easier life because of it

Usage:
Set desired parameters in `src/control*` files, then:
```bash
./lab2.sh
```
and follow the instructions

Usage of comparison of two or more algorithms is explained in lab2.sh file.
